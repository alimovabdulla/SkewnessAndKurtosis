# Overview
This project provides a Python implementation for calculating Skewness and Kurtosis of a given dataset. These two statistical measures help understand the distribution characteristics of the data, such as its asymmetry and the presence of outliers or heavy tails.

Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the data distribution, or how outliers are likely to be present.
Key Concepts
Skewness: Indicates whether the data is skewed to the left or right. A skewness of 0 means a symmetric distribution.
Positive skew: The right tail is longer (right-skewed).
Negative skew: The left tail is longer (left-skewed).
Kurtosis: Indicates the presence of outliers and the sharpness of the peak.
Positive kurtosis (leptokurtic): The data has a sharp peak and fat tails, meaning more outliers.
Negative kurtosis (platykurtic): The data has a flatter peak and lighter tails.
Dependencies
